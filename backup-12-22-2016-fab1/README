These are the KiCad board, schematic, and fabrication outputs for our
Unofficial DEFCON 25 badge.

Stuff in the fabrication folder was set to MacroFab for prototype v1
on 12/20/2016. At today's prices, a board costs about $216 to make, or
$500 for two.

The firmware is available in my checkout of the chibios-orchard repo.

It's not even remotely near done yet, but I'm storing it here to keep
track of things.
