In this folder you will find the KiCad board, schematic, and 
fabrication outputs for our Unofficial DEFCON 25 badge.

Stuff in the fabrication folder was set to MacroFab for prototype v1
on 12/20/2016. At today's prices, a board costs about $216 to make, or
$500 for two. This is for a 4-sided board and is not recommended.

Fabrication-rev4 contains our final and hopefully production gerbers.

Cost is approximately $180 / board for a single run, and this cost 
goes down as you make more boards.

The firmware is available in the cibios-orchard repo.
We are very close to release and this code is nearly in it's final 
form.
