These are the KiCad board, schematic, and fabrication outputs for our
Unofficial DEFCON 25 badge.

Stuff in the fabrication folder was set to MacroFab for prototype v1
on 12/20/2016. At today's prices, a board costs about $216 to make, or
$500 for two. This is for a 4-sided board and is not recommended.

Fabrication rev3 contains our final and hopefully production gerbers.
It was sent out 3/23 to Macrofab, and we're waiting to see if it comes
back working or not. 

The firmware is available in my checkout of the chibios-orchard repo.
